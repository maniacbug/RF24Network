/**
 * @mainpage Network Layer for RF24 Radios
 *
 * This class implements an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer">OSI Network Layer</a> using nRF24L01(+) radios driven
 * by the <a href="http://maniacbug.github.com/RF24/">RF24</a> library.
 *
 * @section Purpose Purpose/Goal
 *
 * Create an alternative to ZigBee radios for Arduino communication.
 *
 * Xbees are excellent little radios, backed up by a mature and robust standard 
 * protocol stack.  They are also expensive.
 *
 * For many Arduino uses, they seem like overkill.  So I am working to build
 * an alternative using nRF24L01 radios.  Modules are available for less than 
 * $6 from many sources.  With the RF24Network layer, I hope to cover many
 * common communication scenarios.
 *
 * Please see the @ref Zigbee page for a comparison against the ZigBee protocols
 *
 * @section Features Features
 *
 * The layer provides:
 * @li Host Addressing.  Each node has a logical address on the local network.
 * @li Message Forwarding.  Messages can be sent from one node to any other, and
 * this layer will get them there no matter how many hops it takes.
 * @li Ad-hoc Joining.  A node can join a network without any changes to any
 * existing nodes.
 *
 * The layer does not (yet) provide:
 * @li Fragmentation/reassembly.  Ability to send longer messages and put them
 * all back together before exposing them up to the app.
 * @li Power-efficient listening.  It would be useful for nodes who are listening
 * to sleep for extended periods of time if they could know that they would miss
 * no traffic.
 * @li Dynamic address assignment.

 *
 * @section Topology Topology for Mesh Networks using nRF24L01(+)
 *
 * This network layer takes advantage of the fundamental capability of the nRF24L01(+) radio to
 * listen actively to up to 6 other radios at once.  The network is arranged in a 
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Topology#Tree">Tree Topology</a>, where
 * one node is the base, and all other nodes are children either of that node, or of another.
 * Unlike a true mesh network, multiple nodes are not connected together, so there is only one
 * path to any given node.
 *
 * @section Octal Octal Addressing
 *
 * Each node must be assigned an 15-bit address by the administrator.  This address exactly
 * describes the position of the node within the tree.  The address is an octal number.  Each
 * digit in the address represents a position in the tree further from the base.
 *
 * @li Node 00 is the base node.
 * @li Nodes 01-05 are nodes whose parent is the base.
 * @li Node 021 is the second child of node 01.
 * @li Node 0321 is the third child of node 021, an so on.
 * @li The largest node address is 05555, so 3,125 nodes are allowed on a single channel.
 *
 * @section Routing How routing is handled
 *
 * When sending a message using RF24Network::write(), you fill in the header with the logical
 * node address.  The network layer figures out the right path to find that node, and sends
 * it through the system until it gets to the right place.  This works even if the two nodes
 * are far separated, as it will send the message down to the base node, and then back out
 * to the final destination.
 *
 * All of this work is handled by the RF24Network::update() method, so be sure to call it
 * regularly or your network will miss packets.
 *
 * @section Startup Starting up a node
 *
 * When a node starts up, it only has to contact its parent to establish communication.
 * No direct connection to the Base node is needed.  This is useful in situations where
 * relay nodes are being used to bridge the distance to the base, so leaf nodes are out
 * of range of the base.
 *
 * @section Directionality Directionality 
 *
 * By default all nodes are always listening, so messages will quickly reach
 * their destination.  
 * 
 * You may choose to sleep any nodes which do not have any active children on the network
 * (i.e. leaf nodes).  This is useful in a case where
 * the leaf nodes are operating on batteries and need to sleep.
 * This is useful for a sensor network.  The leaf nodes can sleep most of the time, and wake
 * every few minutes to send in a reading.  However, messages cannot be sent to these 
 * sleeping nodes.
 *
 * In the future, I plan to write a system where messages can still be passed upward from
 * the base, and get delivered when a sleeping node is ready to receive them.  The radio
 * and underlying driver support 'ack payloads', which will be a handy mechanism for this.
 *
 * @page Zigbee Comparison to ZigBee
 *
 * This network layer is influenced by the design of ZigBee, but does not implement it
 * directly.  
 *
 * @section Advantage Which is better?
 *
 * ZigBee is a much more robust, feature-rich set of protocols, with many different vendors
 * providing compatible chips.
 *
 * RF24Network is cheap.  While ZigBee radios are well over $20, nRF24L01 modules can be found
 * for under $6.  My personal favorite is 
 * <a href="http://www.mdfly.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=82">MDFly RF-IS2401</a>.
 *
 * @section Contrast Similiarities & Differences
 *
 * Here are some comparisons between RF24Network and ZigBee.
 *
 * @li Both networks support Star and Tree topologies.  Only Zigbee supports a true mesh.
 * @li In both networks, only leaf nodes can sleep (see @ref NodeNames).
 * @li ZigBee nodes are configured using AT commands, or a separate Windows application. 
 * RF24 nodes are configured by recompiliing the firmware or writing to EEPROM.
 *
 * @section NodeNames Node Naming
 *
 * @li Leaf node: A node at the outer edge of the network with no children.  ZigBee calls it
 * an End Device node.
 * @li Relay node: A node which has both parents and children, and relays messages from one
 * to the other.  ZigBee calls it a Router.
 * @li Base node.  The top of the tree node with no parents, only children.  Typically this node
 * will bridge to another kind of network like Ethernet.  ZigBee calls it a Co-ordinator node.
